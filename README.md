A frontend project whithin the fullstack course from Lexicon.

The client Munamii Cakery has a cupcake shop on Instagram where she sells 
cupcakes and wedding cakes, etc. 

The task is to make a website as a prototype. Showcasing the Munamii pasteries. All images are from Munamii on Instagram. Names and prices are pure fiction.

Disclaimers  
1. I have personal permission for the store owner to use her company name, 
logotype and product images for learning purposes.  
2. This is not spec work (work done for free in hopes to get elected from a pool of 
contestant and only 1 get paid)

Tech stack: VS Code, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
